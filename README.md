# Calculator

A primitive touch based calculator written for the reMarkable tablet.
The design and functionality are primarily based on the stock Android
Material design calculator found on most Android 5.0+ devices

At the the current state, even for a primitive calculator it is still
lacking a great ammount of features that will be implmeneted in the future.
For instance, an interactive cursor that lets you edit from a specific part
of the calcuation is not yet present, but can be expected soon.

Additionally, the paperwhite display suffers from great latency, which may
make the experienec seem borthersome to some users.

## Tips

Some tips that should be noted:

- To delete the entire calculation, simply **hold** the `DEL` button
- Decimals are floored at 12th decimal
