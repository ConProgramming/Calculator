# Calculator

A primitive touch based calculator written for the reMarkable tablet.
The design and functionality are primarily based on the stock Android
Material design calculator found on most Android 5.0+ devices

At the current state, even for a primitive calculator it is still
lacking a great amount of features that will be implemented in the future.

Additionally, the paper white display suffers from great latency, which may
make the experience seem bothersome to some users.

## Tips

Some tips that should be noted:

- To delete the entire calculation, simply **hold** the 'DEL' button
- Decimals are floored at 12th decimal
- A cursor can be placed and positioned to remove delete
