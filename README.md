# Calculator

A primitive touch based calculator written for the reMarkable tablet.
The design and functionality are primarily based on the stock Android
Material design calculator found on most Android 5.0+ devices

At the current state, even for a primitive calculator it is still
lacking a great amount of features that will be implemented in the future.
For instance, an interactive cursor that lets you edit from a specific part
of the calculation is not yet present, but can be expected soon.

Additionally, the paper white display suffers from great latency, which may
make the experience seem bothersome to some users.

## Tips

Some tips that should be noted:

- To delete the entire calculation, simply **hold** the `DEL` button
- Decimals are floored at 12th decimal
